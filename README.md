# How to ScreenShare for multiple people on MS Teams :woman_technologist:

## About <a name = "about"></a> :page_facing_up:

Since MS Teams doesn't support multiple people sharing their screens and nobody really wants to just use a webcam to share their face or are concerned about recording the call if they do. We should instead use free and open source tool [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). There exist other software that is capable of doing "virtual webcam" just google this term if obs doesn't work or you want to use something else.

## Prerequisites <a name = "start"></a> :computer:

To get started you first will need to go download: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

And you will also need desktop version of [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app).

I won't show you how to install MS Teams. :upside_down_face:

### Installing & Configuring <a name = "config"></a> :file_folder:

First download OBS by choosing windows, clicking on the installer and click next until it's installed.

After you launched OBS for the first time you will be greeted with auto-configuration wizard. Just pick virtual camera option and apply.

Now you wanna add a source, you have two main chooses Display Capture - for full screen sharing, Windows Capture for specific window capture. For now just selected Display Capture and click OK.

Couple more things MS Teams flips the camera horizontally so we should flip the source horizontally too. Right Click on Display Capture > Transform > Flip Horizontally. After we do all that we just click start virtual camera and open MS Teams.

Now in MS Teams open settings and select camera if it's working you should see a preview! :partying_face:
