# How to ScreenShare for multiple people on MS Teams :woman_technologist:

## About :page_facing_up:

Since MS Teams doesn't support multiple people sharing their screens and nobody really wants to just use a webcam to share their face or are concerned about recording the call if they do. We should instead use free and open source tool [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). There exists other software that is capable of doing "virtual webcam." Just Google this term if OBS doesn't work or you want to use something else.

## Prerequisites :computer:

To get started you first will need to go download: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

And you will also need desktop version of [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app).

I won't show you how to install MS Teams. :upside_down_face:

### Installing & Configuring :file_folder:

First, download OBS by choosing Windows, clicking on the installer, and click next until it's installed.

After you launched OBS for the first time, you will be greeted with the auto-configuration wizard; just pick the virtual camera option and apply.

Now, you want to add a source; you have two main choices: Display Capture - for full screen sharing, and Windows Capture: for specific window capture. For now, just select "Display Capture" and click "OK."

A couple of more things: MS Teams flips the camera horizontally, so we should flip the source horizontally, too. Right Click on "Display Capture > Transform > Flip Horizontally."After we do all of that, we just click "Start Virtual Camera" and open MS Teams.

Now, in MS Teams, open settings and select the current camera; if it's working, you should see a preview! :partying_face:
